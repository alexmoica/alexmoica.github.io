								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic_podium.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p align='justify'>
									I am a second year software engineering co-op student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. 
									I will be graduating April 2022 with a Bachelor of Engineering & Co-op degree. My main career interests are 
									in software fields with a focus on machine learning, information security, and android development. Through 
									my involvement in executive roles with McMaster's engineering society, I have also become highly proficient in all
									aspects of leadership - being able to lead and unite teams in identifying and resolving challenges of both technical
									and social nature, all while being accountable to the faculty, university, and provincial organizations.
									<br><br>
									Overall, I am open to learning about any topic in computing and can quickly pick up the essential skills 
									and knowledge necessary for it. The personal projects that I am currently committed to are small in scope 
									and mainly focused on learning and becoming efficient with the given language, IDE, or tool used in them. 
									In the not-too-distant future I plan to shift my focus more on larger projects around global issues in 
									technology and software.

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic_outdoors.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									My interest in computing came from video games when I was young, developing into a curiosity about how they 
									were made and created, from programming, to graphic design, to 3D modelling. After some research, I decided 
									to try my hand at creating games of my own, ranging from simple Scratch and GameMaker games to more advanced 
									Unity 2D and 3D ones. 
									<br><br>
									This gave me a comfortable background in tools such as the Unity Engine, Adobe Photoshop, and Blender. After a 
									while, this interest expanded to applications of all types, leading to where I am today. Outside of technical 
									knowledge, I can speak Romanian as a second language and my hobbies include playing the guitar, Muay Thai, 
									skateboarding, and reading; with some of my favourite authors being Isaac Asimov, Dan Brown, and Frank Herbert.
									<br><br>
									I hope you enjoy your experience on my website and do not hesitate to contact me for any questions or inquiries!
