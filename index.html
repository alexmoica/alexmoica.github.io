					<p>
						Hey, welcome to my website<a id="secret" href="http://divyadolly.com/">!</a> I'm a Software Developer that graduated with a B.Eng (Software Engineering) from McMaster University with a diverse range of skills and experiences in full stack development. I have a passion for space and an interest in a variety of space development technologies. My main career interests are in software fields relating to software and AR/VR development. Through my involvement in executive roles within McMaster's engineering society, I have also become highly proficient in all aspects of leadership - being able to lead and unite teams in identifying and resolving challenges of both technical and social nature, all while being accountable to affected stakeholders and adjudicatory bodies.
						<br><br>
						Overall, I am open to learning about any topic in computing and can quickly pick up the essential skills and knowledge necessary for it. The personal projects that I am currently working on are small in scope and mainly focused on learning and becoming efficient with the given language, IDE, or tool used in them. In the not-too-distant future, I plan to shift my focus more towards larger projects around global issues in technology and software.
