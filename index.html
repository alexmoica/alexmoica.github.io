					<span class="image main"><img src="images/about/pic_podium.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						Hey, welcome to my website! I am a fourth-year software engineering co-op student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada and I will be graduating in April 2022 with a Bachelor of Engineering & Co-op degree. My main career interests are in software fields relating to information security and cybersecurity. Through my involvement in executive roles within McMaster's engineering society, I have also become highly proficient in all aspects of leadership - being able to lead and unite teams in identifying and resolving challenges of both technical and social nature, all while being accountable to affected shareholders and adjudicatory bodies.
						<br><br>
						Overall, I am open to learning about any topic in computing and can quickly pick up the essential skills and knowledge necessary for it. The personal projects that I am currently working on are small in scope and mainly focused on learning and becoming efficient with the given language, IDE, or tool used in them. In the not-too-distant future, I plan to shift my focus more towards larger projects around global issues in technology and software.

							<p class="resumeInfo">
								I can speak three languages, being fluent in both English and Romanian, with a working proficiency in French. I've been practicing Muay Thai since 2016, becoming a junior instructor and having the opportunity to train under a world-champion Kruyai. Although I've decided not to take any amateur or professional fights, I've been able to train and spar with many excellent professional fighters. I have a love for every type of board - having owned skateboards, longboards, and pennyboards, I'm always happy to try out new skateparks in my area! My other hobbies include running, reading science-fiction, and playing both classical and electric guitars!<br><br>

					<hr>
					<p>alexmoica.com is my personal professional website built with a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend. I aim to keep this website regularly updated with major developments in my life, career, and other involvements. The goal of this project was to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS to a long-term project, as well as to have a website to promote myself throughout any future endeavours.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>USCitySP is a program used to find the shortest and most cost-efficient path between any two US cities, providing the most direct path while taking into account stops for food in each city. Written in Java and making use of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, USCitySP outputs the BFS and DFS traces, as well as the shortest path with city names, meal prices, and restaurant addresses, into a text file. The goal of this project was to learn how to create and manipulate graphs and graphing algorithms in Java.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>Food Identifier is a machine learning application created to distinguish between a variety of fruits and vegetables. Based on Tensorflow and using the CIFAR-100 database for training images, this program accepts user-inputted images through a Tkinter GUI and identifies them by type of food. The goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of machine learning and the Tensorflow library implemented in Python.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>Assets is a money management system for PC that dynamically tracks multiple account balances. Assets stores the transaction records for each account into a separate text file, which is used to create live graphs and a history of deposits and withdrawals from the given account. The goal of this project was to learn the basic and advanced features of the standard python graphics library, Tkinter, and how to interface it with the matplotlib library.</p>
