			I am a second year software engineering co-op student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. 
			Assuming nothing changes, I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering with Co-op in 2022. 
			My main career interests are in software fields with a focus on machine learning, information security, 
			and android & web development. I am also comfortable in computer-based applications and software, able to 
			program in Python, Java, and Javascript, while learning C. 
			<br><br>
			Overall, I am open to learning about any topic in computing and can quickly pick up the essential skills 
			and knowledge necessary for it. The personal projects that I am currently committed too are small in scope 
			and mainly focused on learning and becoming efficient with the given language, IDE, or tool used in them. 
			In the not-too-distant future I plan to shift my focus more on larger projects around global issues in 
			technology and software. 
			<br><br>
			My interest in computing came from video games when I was young, developing into a curiosity about how they 
			were made and created, from programming, to graphic design, to 3D modelling. After some research, I decided 
			to try my hand at creating games of my own, ranging from simple Scratch and GameMaker games to more advanced 
			Unity 2D and 3D ones. 
			<br><br>
			This gave me a comfortable background in tools such as the Unity Engine, Adobe Photoshop, and Blender. After a 
			while, this interest expanded to applications of all types, leading to where I am today. Outside of technical 
			knowledge, I can speak Romanian as a second language and my hobbies include playing the guitar, Muay Thai, 
			skateboarding, and reading; with some of my favourite authors being Isaac Asimov, Dan Brown, and Frank Herbert.
			<br><br>
			I hope you enjoy your experience on my website and do not hesitate to contact me for any questions or inquiries!
